description: Generate, update, or audit mod localization (Keyed today; DefInjected once the mod ships its own defs) for a target language, grounded in vanilla RimWorld terminology — particularly Biotech's xenotype/gene vocabulary. Use when asked to add a language, update translations, or check translation freshness.
argument-hint: "[language, e.g. German | update | check]"
---

# Translate

Produce or refresh localization files for Traders Stock Xenogerms. English is
the source of truth; every other language derives from it.

## Non-negotiables

- **Run the checker first and last.** `python3 Scripts/check-translations.py`
  validates key sets, placeholders, DefInjected paths, staleness, and file
  hygiene deterministically. Never hand-derive anything it reports; never
  finish with it failing.
- **Community translations are owned by their contributors.** Update
  stale/missing keys in an existing language when asked, but do not rewrite a
  contributor's phrasing wholesale without the user's explicit direction.
- **Machine-assisted output is a first pass.** PRs and commits containing
  generated translations must say so and invite native-speaker review.
- **Keep the public roster current.** CONTRIBUTING.md's localization table
  (Planned / Machine-assisted / Native, plus credit) must be updated in the
  same commit whenever a language is added or a native review lands. The
  target roster lives there — consult it before proposing new languages.
  Today it lists English only, so there is nothing yet to reconcile, but the
  rule stands from the first added language onward.

## File map and conventions

- English Keyed source: `1.6/Languages/English/Keyed/TSX_UI.xml` — a single
  file covering the mod settings window (pricing sliders, toggles, reset
  button) and any other player-facing prose this mod owns. Unlike the
  weapon-mod siblings, there is no second Keyed file and no per-trait or
  per-weapon prose to split out.
- **This mod ships no Defs of its own.** `1.6/Patches/**` are XML Patches
  (`PatchOperationAdd` / `PatchOperationSequence`) that bolt comps and
  StatParts (`CompXenotypeSource`, `StatPart_XenogermValue`,
  `StatPart_XenogermSellFactor`) onto vanilla `Xenogerm` / `TraderKindDef` /
  `StatDef` entries — none of them add a `label`, `description`, or any
  other translatable field. So the DefInjected surface is currently
  **empty** (audited 2026-08), and any
  `1.6/Languages/<Language>/DefInjected/` work is expected to be a no-op,
  guarded by the `Scripts/expected-injections.json` sidecar (see below)
  rather than by a hand-maintained "nothing to do here" note. If this mod
  ever ships its own Def subclass (a custom `StockGenerator` variant, say,
  with its own label), translate it per language via DefInjected exactly as
  the sibling mods do — everything below about `<DefTypeFolder>` resolution
  applies unchanged the day that happens.
- Target layout: `1.6/Languages/<Language>/Keyed/*.xml` and (once non-empty)
  `1.6/Languages/<Language>/DefInjected/<DefTypeFolder>/*.xml`.
- `<DefTypeFolder>` must be the def's resolvable type name: bare for vanilla
  types (`ThingDef`, `StatDef`, `TraderKindDef`, ...). A
  namespace-qualified folder (`TradersStockXenogerms.<DefClass>`) would only
  be needed for a def whose *type* this mod itself defines — none exist
  today, but the rule is decompile-verified and load-bearing, not
  organizational (see next bullet), so it's recorded here in advance rather
  than rediscovered later.
- **The type folder is load-bearing, not organizational** (decompile-verified,
  `Verse.LoadedLanguage`): RimWorld enumerates only the top-level directories
  under `DefInjected/` and resolves each directory *name* to the def type its
  files target. An `.xml` placed directly in `DefInjected/` is never loaded,
  and the checker likewise iterates only directories — a misplaced file fails
  silently on both sides, so never flatten the tree. *Inside* a type folder
  everything is free: file names are arbitrary and files are found
  recursively, so one bundled file per type vs one-def-per-file is pure
  preference. (The loader even tolerates a pluralized folder name by
  retrying with the last character stripped — `ThingDefs` → `ThingDef` — but
  the checker does not; use exact type names.)
- DefInjected keys are `DefName.field` paths (e.g. what `Xenogerm.label`
  would look like, were this mod ever to own that def rather than patch
  it). There are currently no DefInjected keys this mod is responsible for
  — the checker's `required` subset of the `Scripts/expected-injections.json`
  sidecar should come back empty for this repo — and the checker still
  errors on any cross-language drift the moment a key does appear.
- **Some translatable fields can exist without ever appearing in this
  repo's own XML** — this is the general lesson the sibling mods learned
  the hard way (inherited labels, comp-default strings, vanilla base-def
  fields reached only through a patch), and it applies here too: a
  `CompProperties_*` or `StatPart_*` this mod adds in C# could in principle
  expose a translatable string without ever touching a def file. None
  currently do (audited 2026-08 — both comps are silent, and the StatParts
  only adjust numbers). The authority for what actually needs translating
  is never a hand-maintained list, it's the `Scripts/expected-injections.json`
  sidecar, a dump of every injection point the live game sees, regenerated
  by `Scripts/refresh-translation-expectations.py` (launches the game with
  the `../L10nProbe` dev mod). The checker enforces the sidecar's `required`
  subset per language and fails on stale expectations, so new content of
  *any* shape forces a regen rather than a manifest edit.
- **EN comment convention (required):** every translated entry carries the
  current English source directly above it:
  `<!-- EN: Reset to defaults -->` — this is how the checker detects
  staleness.
- Formatting: UTF-8 without BOM, LF endings, 2-space indent, final newline,
  root element `<LanguageData>`.
- Placeholders (`{0}`, `{1}`, named args) must match English exactly per key.
  Translator comments above placeholdered English keys explain what gets
  injected — e.g. a silver amount or a percentage — so the phrasing around
  them can be planned before translating.

## Terminology grounding (do not skip)

Every game term must match the official localization, not a plausible
translation. Sources, in order:

1. Vanilla language data:
   `"$RIMWORLD_PATH"/Data/<Expansion>/Languages/<Language> (<Native>).tar`
   (read entries with `tar -xOf`). Check **Core plus Biotech** — Biotech is
   this mod's required DLC and the expansion where every xenotype/gene term
   in vanilla's own localization lives. Neither Odyssey nor Royalty matters
   here; those are the weapon-mod siblings' domain.
2. This file's glossary below (lessons already learned — apply them).
3. If a term appears nowhere official, flag it in the PR for native review
   rather than inventing silently.

Terms that MUST be grounded before use: xenogerm, xenotype, gene, archite
gene, gene complexity, metabolism (the gene stat, not the pawn need),
inheritable vs. non-inheritable genes, custom xenotype, and orbital-trader /
market-value vocabulary ("Traders will pay more/less for it" and similar
phrasing, market value, silver). **None of this repo's own glossary rows
below have been grounded yet.** The sibling mods' Odyssey/Royalty-grounded
weapon rows are irrelevant here, and no language pass in this repo has yet
run a Biotech-grounded generation. Treat every glossary table below as
**style/mechanics reference only** until an actual generation pass grounds
xenogerm/xenotype vocabulary against the Biotech tar and records it here.

### Glossary — shared across the mod family

The style rules, worker mechanics and cross-language lessons below were
learned across the weapon-mod siblings (`../UniqueMeleeWeapons`,
`../UniqueWeaponsUnbound`, `../PersonaWeaponsUnbound`) generating melee- and
gun-domain content, and this repo now joins that family. Everything about
*how a language's `LanguageWorker` behaves* — quoting conventions,
punctuation, formality, dash/ellipsis rules, Korean josa markers, German
case vs. gender, French elision, Spanish/Portuguese contraction — is
mechanical fact about RimWorld's translation engine, independent of whether
a mod is about weapons or xenogerms, and is reproduced below unchanged. What
does **not** carry over verbatim is the glossary *tables*: they were built
for melee-weapon vocabulary (weapon names, damage types, tool labels, trait
adjectives, quest vocabulary) this mod has no use for, since it ships no
ThingDefs, no RulePackDefs, and no combat or quest text of its own. Each
table below keeps only the rows that are domain-independent (UI buttons,
quality tiers) or directly relevant to a trader mod (market-value/trader
phrasing); the dropped rows are still correct and native-reviewed — they
just live in the weapon-mod skills, which remain the source for that
vocabulary if a future feature ever needs it. Mirror a correction the other
direction too: if generating this mod's languages surfaces a fix to a truly
*shared* row (a button label, a punctuation rule), propagate it back into
the siblings.

#### Russian (from UWU PR #6 native review)

| English | Use | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cancel (button) | Отменить | Отмена | vanilla `Cancel`; buttons use infinitive verbs |
| report/inspect strings | noun phrases | finite verbs | matches inspect-pane convention |

The dropped rows (weapon `trait`, gun `charge`) and the mod-decided
WeaponCategoryDef labels are weapon-domain vocabulary with no equivalent in
this mod — see `../UniqueMeleeWeapons`'s skill if that ever changes. This
repo has not yet run a Russian generation pass; add xenogerm/xenotype rows
here once one lands.

#### Japanese (from the weapon-mod siblings' 2026-07 generation)

RimWorld's language folder is `Japanese` (tar: `Japanese (日本語).tar`).

Style rules discovered from the vanilla JP data (mandatory):

- Vanilla JP uses ASCII punctuation: `,` and `.` — never `、` or `。`.
- Descriptions/tooltips: polite です/ます form ending `.`; labels/buttons take
  no period.
- Quote injected def labels and cross-referenced UI labels with 「」. Suffixes
  and parentheticals take no leading space and use ASCII parens.
- DLC names stay in Latin script (Biotech, Royalty, Odyssey), as does MOD.

| English | Use | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cancel / Reset / Reset to defaults | キャンセル / リセット / デフォルトに戻す | | vanilla Keyed buttons |
| quality tiers | 壊れかけ/低品質/標準品/良品/秀品/名品/幻の一品 | | Core `QualityCategory_*` |
| Traders will pay more/less for it. | 貿易商は高値で/低い価格でこれを買い取ります. | | Odyssey `GoldInlay`/`Ugly` descs — reuse verbatim; directly relevant to this mod's trader-price framing |

The rest of the weapon-mod Japanese glossary — weapon/tool/damage
vocabulary, the attributive-form (`の`/`な`-terminated) requirement for
`traitAdjectives`, the `[stuff_adjective]の[noun]` name-grammar composition,
and battle-log grammar — is specific to `RulePackDef` name generation and
melee combat text, which this mod has none of. See `../UniqueMeleeWeapons`
if that ever changes. This repo has not yet run a Japanese generation pass;
add xenogerm/xenotype rows here once one lands.

#### Simplified Chinese (from the weapon-mod siblings' 2026-07 generation)

RimWorld's language folder is `ChineseSimplified` (tar: `ChineseSimplified
(简体中文).tar`) — the mod's folder must match it exactly, whatever the
public roster calls the language.

Style rules discovered from the vanilla zh data (mandatory):

- Full-width punctuation in prose (，。、；：（）……); descriptions end with 。;
  labels and buttons carry no trailing period. Placeholders, digits and units
  stay ASCII. Vanilla labels use full-width parens: 锻造台（燃料）.
- Quote cited names in prose with full-width curly quotes — vanilla writes
  任务"{0}". Terse stat templates take no quotes ({0}伤害).
- Vanilla zh files can contain untranslated English values — vanilla
  incompleteness is not style guidance. Some vanilla zh files carry a BOM;
  ours never do.

| English | Use | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| quality tiers | 极差/较差/一般/良好/极佳/大师级/传奇级 | | Core `QualityCategory_*` |

The rest of the weapon-mod Simplified Chinese glossary — weapon/tool/damage
vocabulary, the bare-attributive-word requirement for `traitAdjectives`, and
the name-grammar composition rules (的/之 linking, material compounding) — is
specific to `RulePackDef` name generation and melee combat text, which this
mod has none of. See `../UniqueMeleeWeapons` if that ever changes. This repo
has not yet run a Simplified Chinese generation pass; add xenogerm/xenotype
rows here once one lands.

#### Korean (from the weapon-mod siblings' 2026-07 generation)

Language folder is `Korean` (tar: `Korean (한국어).tar`). Decompile-verified
why the paren-stripped name works: `LoadedLanguage` derives
`legacyFolderName` by cutting at `(`, and mod language dirs match on
*either* `folderName` or `legacyFolderName` — the same mechanism behind
`Japanese`.

**Josa (particle) markers are the one hard mechanical rule Korean adds, and
nothing else in this skill has an equivalent — and it applies to any Keyed
string, not just combat/rulepack text.** Korean particles are allomorphic:
the correct form depends on whether the previous syllable ends in a
consonant, which is unknowable when the preceding text is an injected value
(a silver amount, a def label, anything from `{0}`).
`Verse.LanguageWorker_Korean.ReplaceJosa` (decompile-verified) resolves
exactly eight tokens, and no others:

```
(이)가   (와)과   (을)를   (은)는   (아)야   (이)어   (으)로   (이)
```

- Every *allomorphic* particle following `{0}`, `[symbol]` or `[TOKEN_x]` MUST use
  a marker. `{0}(을)를 생성` is correct; `{0}를 생성` breaks on consonant-final
  labels. Only five distinctions inflect (은/는, 이/가, 을/를, 와/과, 으로/로);
  **`에`, `에서` and `의` are invariant** — write those bare after a placeholder.
- Never hand-roll `{0}을(를)` — the worker does not recognize it.
- **Spelling is exact, and `(와)과` is asymmetric.** For every token the paren
  holds the post-*consonant* form — except `(와)과`, where `JosaPatternPaired`
  maps to `("과","와")`, so the paren holds the post-*vowel* form.
- **A marker resolving off a digit is always wrong.** `HasJong()` falls back to
  `AlphabetEndPattern` = `{b,c,k,l,m,n,p,q,t}` for non-Korean chars, which has no
  digits, so a number always yields the vowel form — right for 2/4/5/9
  (이·사·오·구), wrong for 1(일) 3(삼) 6(육) 7(칠) 8(팔) 0(영). Phrase around it,
  never mark it — this matters directly for a settings window with numeric
  sliders (silver amounts, percentages).
- **Quoting interacts with resolution.** `FindLastChar` skips a preceding `"`,
  `'` or `)` to reach the real final character, so `"{0}"(을)를` resolves
  correctly. Curly `" "` and corner `「 」` are **not** skipped, so the token
  is returned unresolved and the raw `(은)는` shows on screen. Korean
  therefore needs no defensive quoting at all — josa does the job quoting
  does in ja/ru/zh.
- The one safe unmarked case: a symbol that always resolves the same way (a
  fixed pronoun). Def labels, numbers, and any mod-coined term are never
  safe.
- A lint for this lives outside the repo checker (which is language-agnostic).

Other style rules discovered from the vanilla ko data (mandatory):

- ASCII punctuation (`.` `,`), never `。`. Descriptions/tooltips take polite
  formal `-습니다.`/`-입니다.`; labels, buttons and stat fragments take no
  trailing period.
- Korean **uses spaces**, unlike JP/zh.
- Units attach with no space: `{0}시간`, `{0}일`, `{0}칸`. Some vanilla ko
  files carry a BOM; ours never do.

| English | Use | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cancel / Reset / Reset all | 취소 / 초기화 / 모두 초기화 | | Core Keyed |
| quality tiers | 끔찍/빈약/평범/상급/완벽/걸작/전설적 | | Core `QualityCategory_*` |
| Traders will pay more/less for it. | 상인들이 더 높은 값을 쳐줍니다. / 상인들은 더 적은 돈을 쳐줍니다. | | Odyssey `GoldInlay`/`Ugly` — reuse verbatim; directly relevant to this mod's trader-price framing |

**Cross-checked against PWU's own ko pass, landed the same day, independently
grounded** — worth keeping as a caution even though the specific rows are
weapon-domain: two rows genuinely diverged between sibling mods on the same
term (`mechanite`, `armor penetration`) because each was grounded against a
different tar subset. **Ground TSX's own Biotech-domain terms independently
against the Biotech tar rather than assuming a weapon-mod sibling's word for
an adjacent concept transfers.**

The rest of the weapon-mod Korean glossary — weapon/tool/damage vocabulary
and the extensive mod-decided trait-adjective list — is specific to melee
combat text, which this mod has none of. See `../UniqueMeleeWeapons` if that
ever changes. This repo has not yet run a Korean generation pass; add
xenogerm/xenotype rows here once one lands.

#### German (preseeded from PersonaWeaponsUnbound's 2026-07-28 generation,
extended across the weapon-mod siblings 2026-07-28)

Language folder is `German` (tar: `German (Deutsch).tar`).

Style rules from the vanilla de data (mandatory, applies to any Keyed
string regardless of mod domain):

- **ASCII single quotes** for cited def labels and UI labels — vanilla writes
  `Forschungsprojekt '{0}'`. Core+Royalty Keyed ship 140 single-quoted
  placeholders and **zero** German `„…"`. Never use `„ "`, `» «`, or curly
  quotes. Pawn names are not quoted.
- **En dash `–`, never em dash `—`** (20 vs 0). English source uses `—`, so
  every dash needs converting; `<!-- EN: -->` comments keep the English form
  verbatim.
- Ellipsis is ASCII `...` (74 in Core Keyed, `…` zero).
- Descriptions end with `.`; labels and buttons take none. Player-facing
  prose is informal **du** with imperatives, never Sie.

**Case is the German landmine, not gender** (decompile-verified:
`Verse.GrammarResolverSimple`, `LanguageWorker_German`, `LanguageWordInfo`).
`"key".Translate(args)` — i.e. any ordinary Keyed string, exactly what this
mod's settings window uses — reaches `GrammarResolverSimple`. Its `obj is
string` branch supports `{0_gender ? m : f : n}`, `{0_definite}`,
`{0_indefinite}`, `{0_plural}` on a plain string, resolving gender from the
word itself via `WordInfo/Gender/{Male,Female,Neuter,Other}.txt` (~2450
nouns in Core). But it implements **no `lookup` function**, so `{lookup:
{0}; decline; N}` — the only route to the 2457-row `decline.txt` case forms
— is unavailable there, and de's article helpers are nominative-only.
Gender is solvable, case is not: restructure any oblique slot (a sentence
needing a dative/accusative/genitive form of an injected label) rather than
guessing an article. A gender lookup that misses **defaults to masculine**
(`ResolveGender`'s `defaultGender`) — safe only for vanilla nouns in
nominative slots, never for a mod-coined label absent from the Gender
tables.

`PostProcessed` also rewrites a trailing English `'s` to `s` (or a bare `'`
after s/ß/z/x/ce) — a closing ASCII single quote immediately followed by
lowercase `s` is silently mangled, so never write `'{0}'s` in German prose.

| English | Use | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cancel / Reset / Confirm / Randomize | Abbrechen / Zurücksetzen / Bestätigen / Zufällig | | Core buttons |
| Reset to defaults / default | Auf Standard zurücksetzen / Standard | | Core `ResetBinding`, `Default` |
| None | Nichts | Keine | Core `None` |
| quality / tiers | Qualität / übel·schlecht·normal·gut·exzellent·meisterlich·legendär | | Core `Quality`, `QualityCategory_*` |
| "{0} quality or better" | `Qualität {0} oder besser` | | reshaped from Core `NormalQualityOrBetter` (pre-inflected, untemplatable) |

The rest of the weapon-mod German glossary — weapon/tool/damage vocabulary,
the `namerLabels`/`traitAdjectives` `|M|`/`|F|`/`|N|` gender-marker scheme
for `RulePackDef`s, the relic-name truncation rule, and the "never *print*
a `[X_definite]'s` genitive" battle-log lesson — is specific to
`RulePackDef` name generation and melee combat text, neither of which this
mod has (it ships no RulePackDefs). See `../UniqueMeleeWeapons` or
`../PersonaWeaponsUnbound` if that ever changes. This repo has not yet run
a German generation pass; add xenogerm/xenotype rows here once one lands.

#### Spanish (Castellano) (from the weapon-mod siblings' 2026-07-29 generation)

RimWorld ships **two** Spanish languages: `Spanish (Español(Castellano)).tar` and
`SpanishLatin (Español(Latinoamérica)).tar`. The roster's "Spanish" means the
Castilian one, so the mod folder is `Spanish` (the parenthetical is stripped by
`legacyFolderName`, same mechanism as `Japanese`/`Korean`). A LatAm pass would be a
separate `SpanishLatin` folder, not an edit to this one.

`Verse.LanguageWorker_Spanish` is decompiled and **imposes no hidden
authoring requirements** — no `PostProcessed` override (unlike German), no
particle system (unlike Korean). It prepends `el/la/los/las` and
`un/una/unos/unas` from the word's gender, returns names unchanged, has
full `Pluralize` rules plus a `plural.txt` lookup, and renders ordinals
`N.º`. Notably it does **not** contract `de el`/`a el` — that is the
author's job (see below).

Style rules from the vanilla es data (mandatory):

- **ASCII straight double quotes** for cited def labels: vanilla writes
  `La misión se llama "{0}".` — 7689 ASCII `"` against **7** curly `“` and
  **zero** guillemets `«»`.
- **Inverted opening marks are required**: `¿…?`, `¡…!` (168 / 433 in Core).
- **Zero dashes.** Core+DLC contain **no** em dashes and **no** en dashes, so
  an English `—` must be **reflowed**, not converted. This is the opposite
  of German, which mandates `–`.
- Ellipsis is ASCII `...`. Descriptions end `.`; labels, buttons and stat
  fragments take none, and labels are lowercase noun phrases.
- **Informal tú with imperatives**, decisively: Explora 12 / Explore 0,
  Asegúrate 41 / Asegúrese 0, `tu colonia` 61 / `su colonia` 3.

**`de el` → `del` and `a el` → `al` must be contracted by hand** whenever a
sentence places `de`/`a` directly before an injected `[X_definite]` symbol
(available even in a plain `.Translate()` call, not just a rulepack — see
the German note above on `GrammarResolverSimple`). Core es fixes this 89
times with the colour code baked into the search pattern:

```
{replace: de [RECIPIENT_definite]; "de &lt;color=#D09B61FF>el "-"&lt;color=#D09B61FF>del "}
{replace: a [RECIPIENT_definite]; "a &lt;color=#D09B61FF>el "-"&lt;color=#D09B61FF>al "}
```

Feminine (`de la pirata`) and named entities simply don't match and pass
through untouched, which is correct. **Core es also ships a shorter, buggy
variant** (`{replace: de [X]; ">el "-">del "}`, 20 uses in
`RulePacks_CombatRanged`) that leaves the literal `de ` outside the match
and renders "de del proyectil" — copy the full form only, or restructure so
no `de`/`a` precedes a `_definite` symbol.

**`[RECIPIENT_possessive]` resolves to `su` and has NO plural form** — Core
`Keyed/Grammar.xml` sets `Prohis`/`Proher`/`Proits` all to `su`. Since
Spanish `su` agrees in number with the *possessed* noun, the symbol is only
safe before a **singular** noun. Use the definite article for plurals
instead.

| English | Use | Never | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cancel / Reset / Confirm / Default / None | `Cancelar` / `Restablecer` / `Confirmar` / `Por defecto` / `Ninguno` | | Core buttons |

| Traders will pay more/less for it. | `Los comerciantes pagarán más por ella.` / `… menos por ella.` | | Odyssey `GoldInlay`/`Ugly` — reuse verbatim; directly relevant to this mod's trader-price framing |

The rest of the weapon-mod Spanish glossary — weapon/tool/damage
vocabulary, the `badass_concept`/`conceptF` parallel-symbol-family
technique for `RulePackDef` gender, `traitAdjectives`/`namerLabels` shape
rules, and quest-site vocabulary — is specific to name generation and melee
combat, which this mod has none of. See `../UniqueMeleeWeapons` if that
ever changes. This repo has not yet run a Spanish generation pass; add
xenogerm/xenotype rows here once one lands.

#### French (from the weapon-mod siblings' 2026-07-29 generation)

Language folder is `French` (tar: `French (Français).tar`).

**`LanguageWorker_French` rewrites every string, and this is the finding
that shapes everything else** (decompile-verified) — including plain
`.Translate()` Keyed strings, not just rulepacks. Its `PostProcessed` runs
five regexes in order:

```
ElisionE   \b(ce|de|je|le|me|ne|se|te|que|quoique|lorsque) + vowel   → c' d' j' l' m' n' s' t' qu' ...
ElisionLa  \bla + vowel                                             → l'
ElisionSi  \bsi il(s)                                               → s'il(s)
DeLe       \bde le(s)                                               → de / des
ALe        \bà le(s)                                                → au / aux
```

**So French is the inverse of Spanish: never hand-contract.** Write `de` /
`le` / `la` plainly and the worker fixes it. Two traps in it:

- **`de le` becomes `de`, not `du`.** Group 2 captures only `e`/`es`, so
  `de les X` correctly yields "des X" but `de le X` yields "de X" — a
  vanilla bug, not guidance to imitate; restructure so the entity is a
  subject, or use an agent phrase — **`par [X_definite]` never contracts**
  and is the clean escape.
- **`IsVowel` includes `h`**, so the worker cannot tell *h muet* from
  *h aspiré* and elides both. Never place an elidable word directly before
  an h-initial noun without checking which kind it is.

`WithDefiniteArticle`/`WithIndefiniteArticle` are **overridden**, handling
`l'` before a vowel and `le`/`la` by gender directly — so `[X_definite]` is
reliable in French even in a plain Keyed string. `Pluralize` knows
`-al`→`-aux`, `-au`/`-eu`→`+x`, and leaves `s`/`x`/`z` alone.

Style rules from the vanilla fr data (mandatory):

- **Formality is `vous`, decisively** — 564 `vous` against **zero**
  `tu`/`Tu` in Core+DLC Keyed. This is the opposite of German and Spanish,
  both informal. Imperatives are the vous form (`Explorez`, `Faites
  attention`).
- **ASCII straight double quotes** for cited def labels — 356 ASCII `"`
  against 14 guillemets `«»` (inconsistently spaced) and **zero** curly `“`.
- **ASCII apostrophe `'`**, not `’` (1991 vs 65) — load-bearing, not
  cosmetic: the elision worker emits ASCII `'`, so a curly one would not
  match.
- **A space before `:` `;` `!` `?`**, per French typography — a **plain
  ASCII space**, not a no-break or narrow space.
- **Zero dashes.** An English `—` must be **reflowed**, as in Spanish and
  unlike German, which mandates `–`. Ellipsis is ASCII `...`.
- Descriptions end `.`; labels, buttons and stat fragments take none, and
  labels are lowercase noun phrases.

**`[X_possessive]` is structurally wrong in French.** Core
`Keyed/Grammar.xml` sets `Prohis`=`son`, `Proher`=`sa`, `Proits`=`son/sa` —
resolved from the **possessor's** gender — but French `son`/`sa` must agree
with the **possessed** noun. The symbol therefore keys off the wrong entity
no matter what; write the possessive literally instead (Core's own
`[RECIPIENT_possessive]de son travail` renders the broken "sonde son
travail", which is vanilla's own evidence not to use it).

#### Brazilian Portuguese (from the weapon-mod siblings' 2026-07-29 generation)

Language folder is **`PortugueseBrazilian`** (tar: `PortugueseBrazilian
(Português Brasileiro).tar`). RimWorld ships European `Portuguese` as a
*separate* language; a pt-PT pass would be its own folder.
`LanguageInfo.xml` declares `languageWorkerClass`
**`LanguageWorker_Portuguese`** — the two languages share one worker.

**The worker does almost nothing, and that is the finding that shapes
everything else** (decompile-verified). It overrides **only**
`WithIndefiniteArticle` and `WithDefiniteArticle` (prepending `o `/`a `/`os
`/`as `, `um `/`uma `/`uns `/`umas ` by gender). It has **no
`PostProcessed` override**, so the base `LanguageWorker.PostProcessed`
runs — and that only calls `MergeMultipleSpaces()`. No elision, no
contraction, no `'s` rewriting, no particles.

**So Portuguese is the hard case: its contractions are orthographically
mandatory and nothing supplies them.** `de`+`o`=`do`, `de`+`a`=`da`,
`em`+`o`=`no`, `em`+`a`=`na`, `a`+`o`=`ao`, `a`+`a`=`à`, `por`+`o`=`pelo`
(plus every plural). Consequences, relevant to any Keyed prose that injects
a definite-article'd label, not only rulepacks:

- **Never write `de` / `em` / `a` / `por` directly before a `[X_definite]`
  symbol.** `_definite` prepends a bare `o `, nothing fuses it, and the
  literal **"de o pirata"** ships — and **vanilla pt-BR ships exactly this
  bug** in its own combat packs. Frequency is not correctness.
- **The clean escapes are `com`, `para`, `contra`, `sem`, `sobre`,
  `entre`** — none contract with the article. Otherwise restructure so the
  entity is a subject.
- **The idiomatic vanilla technique is to use the bare `[X_label]` and
  write the contracted article yourself, hedged**: Core's ranged pack
  writes `do(a) [INITIATOR_label]`.
- There are **zero `{replace:}` blocks** anywhere in pt-BR's rulepacks —
  don't invent one; restructure instead.

Style rules from the vanilla pt-BR data (mandatory):

- **ASCII straight double quotes**, **zero em/en dashes** (reflow an
  English `—`, as in es and fr — the opposite of de), ASCII ellipsis `...`
  and apostrophe `'`.
- **No space before `:` `;` `!` `?`** — the exact opposite of French, and
  the two languages are otherwise close enough that this is an easy
  cross-contamination.
- No `¿`/`¡` — that is Spanish only.
- **Formality is `você`, decisively** — imperatives take the você form
  (`Clique`, `Selecione`, `Escolha`, `Certifique-se`, `Faça`).
- Descriptions end `.`; labels, buttons and stat fragments take none, and
  labels are lowercase.

**Gender hedging is a distinct technique from every other language here,
and pt-BR applies it to the surface text itself**, pervasively — articles,
participles, contractions and possessives alike get a literal **`(a)`**:
`O(a)`, `um(a)`, `do(a)`, `pelo(a)`. A `.Translate()` / templated string
instead takes the inline resolver split (`{PAWN_gender ? o : a}`); which
shape applies depends on whether the string is plain Keyed prose (literal
`(a)`) or a resolver-fed template (inline split) — check the field, not a
blanket rule.

**`[X_possessive]` is unusable here too, for a different reason than
French.** Core `Keyed/Grammar.xml` sets `Prohis`=`o`, `Proher`=`a`,
`Proits`=`o(a)` — a bare **definite article**, not a possessive pronoun,
keyed off the **possessor's** gender while Portuguese must agree with the
**possessed** noun. Write the possessive literally, as French does, though
for a distinct underlying reason — check `Keyed/Grammar.xml`'s actual
values rather than assuming the symbol inflects.

The rest of the weapon-mod pt-BR glossary — weapon/tool/damage vocabulary,
the preposed-namer constraint that forces gender-invariant
`traitAdjectives`, the curated `Strings/Words/Nouns/Weapons.txt` corpus, and
quest-site vocabulary — is specific to name generation and melee combat
text, which this mod has none of. See `../UniqueMeleeWeapons` if that ever
changes. This repo has not yet run a Brazilian Portuguese generation pass;
add xenogerm/xenotype rows here once one lands.

### Cross-language lessons

- Wrap injected `{0}` def labels in the language's quote marks (JP 「{0}」,
  RU «{0}», zh-Hans "{0}") — injected labels never inflect, and quoting
  sidesteps case and agreement problems. **Korean is the exception, and
  porting the ja form actively breaks it**: ko solves the same problem
  mechanically with josa markers, and `FindLastChar` looks through only
  ASCII `'` `"` `)` to find the syllable that decides the particle. Curly
  `" "` and corner `「 」` are not skipped, so `「{0}」(을)를` silently ships an
  unresolved `(을)를`. Inject bare and mark the particle instead.
- **Check whether the worker contracts before writing any contraction
  scaffolding — the answer inverts between languages.** Spanish must fuse
  `de`+`el` by hand (in a rulepack or in any `.Translate()` call using
  `[X_definite]`); French must do the **opposite and write nothing**,
  because `LanguageWorker_French.PostProcessed` elides and fuses
  automatically, so hand-contracting would double-apply; Portuguese is the
  worst case, where contractions are mandatory and nothing supplies them at
  all — see the German/Spanish/French/pt-BR sections above for the
  specifics. Verify a vanilla pattern actually works before copying it;
  frequency is not correctness (both es and fr ship a demonstrably broken
  contraction in their own combat packs).
- **A "no hidden mechanics" worker is itself a finding, not a reason to
  skip the check.** Spanish's and Portuguese's workers impose few or no
  authoring requirements, but Portuguese's *absence* of a `PostProcessed`
  override is precisely what makes every contraction the author's problem.
  Read what the worker does **not** do as carefully as what it does, and
  note that languages can share one worker class (`PortugueseBrazilian` and
  `Portuguese` both use `LanguageWorker_Portuguese`).
- **The possessive symbol (`[X_possessive]`/`Prohis`/`Proher`/`Proits`) has
  a different correct answer per language, so never generalize one.**
  Korean drops it, German keeps and inflects it inline, Spanish keeps it
  only before a singular noun, French and Portuguese both must write the
  possessive literally, for two different underlying reasons. Check
  `Keyed/Grammar.xml`'s actual values for the target language rather than
  assuming the symbol inflects.
- **A def field's official label can differ across the def *types* that
  share its name or concept**, and translating from the wrong one is an
  easy, invisible error (es Core's DamageDef `Stab`=`apuñalamiento` vs
  HediffDef `Stab`=`puñalada`, for instance — see the weapon-mod skills for
  the full pattern). This mod patches both a `StatDef` (`MarketValue`,
  `SellPriceFactor`) and a `ThingDef` (`Xenogerm`) — if either ever grows a
  translatable field, confirm which def *type*'s official label you're
  grounding against, not just the term.
- **When two vanilla files disagree, prefer the nearer analog, not the
  more central one.** es Core's generic ColorDefs render purple `morado`,
  but Odyssey's own colour defs — same def type, same purpose — render it
  `púrpura`. For this mod that means: if Biotech's own xenotype/gene Keyed
  data and Core's generic item/trader vocabulary ever disagree on a term,
  Biotech wins.
- **Don't spend a vanilla word on the wrong slot.** Map any concept this
  mod needs against vanilla's existing usage of that word *first* (e.g.
  don't reuse a word Biotech already spends on a specific gene or xenotype
  concept for something else), and coin only for what's genuinely left
  over.
- **Distinguish comment occurrences from value occurrences when mining the
  tar.** Grepping a symbol across a language's files counts English
  `<!-- EN: -->` text too, which can invert the conclusion about whether a
  symbol is actually used in translated values. Strip comments before
  counting.
- **Check for a `LanguageWorker_<Language>` before generating.** It
  post-processes every string, so it can impose authoring requirements no
  amount of reading the vanilla data will reveal as *mandatory* — Korean's
  josa markers are invisible until you find `ReplaceJosa`. Decompile it:
  `ilspycmd "$RIMWORLD_PATH/RimWorldWin64_Data/Managed/Assembly-CSharp.dll" -t
  "Verse.LanguageWorker_<Language>"`. Languages with heavy inflection
  (Russian, Polish, Turkish, Czech, German) are the ones to check first. **A
  worker can also do work *for* you**, which is just as important to
  know — French's elides and contracts automatically, so the correct
  authoring there is to write the uncontracted form and leave it alone.
- **Simulate the worker rather than reasoning about it.** Its regexes are
  short enough to reimplement in a few lines of Python, and running your
  actual strings through them catches what eyeballing does not.
- **Know which resolver your strings actually reach** (decompile-verified).
  `"key".Translate(args)` — every Keyed string this mod has — goes to
  `Verse.GrammarResolverSimple`, *not* the full rulepack `GrammarResolver`,
  and the two support different things. On a plain `string` arg
  `GrammarResolverSimple` gives you `{N_gender ? … : … : …}`,
  `{N_definite}`, `{N_indefinite}`, `{N_plural}` and the pronoun family —
  gender is looked up from the word itself via `LanguageWordInfo`, so no
  `NamedArgument` metadata is needed. It implements **no `lookup` function
  at all**, so `{lookup: {0}; decline; N}` and every case form it would
  produce are unavailable there. For inflecting languages that means
  gender is usually solvable and **case is not**: restructure so nothing
  has to agree with the injected label. See the German section above for
  worked rewrites.
- **The checker compares argument placeholders, not grammar constructs,
  and that distinction is deliberate.** `{0}`/`{PAWN_labelShort}`-style
  placeholders are supplied by the C# call site and must match English
  exactly; `{PAWN_gender ? o : a}` is inflection the target language needs
  and uninflected English never has. `Scripts/check-translations.py`
  excludes any `{...}` containing `?` before comparing (see the comment on
  `GRAMMAR_CONSTRUCT_RE`). Confirm the named argument actually exists at
  the call site before relying on one.
- When an English string is reworded, refresh the EN comments in every
  language **in the same commit** — the checker reports the mismatch as
  STALE either way, but batching avoids churn.
- Coined vanilla terms may be a portmanteau in one language and a plain
  word in another — always check, never extrapolate between languages.
- Mod-coined terms recur across Keyed prose that restates them. When
  generation is chunked across files or subagents, reconcile those terms
  across the whole language before committing.

The RulePackDef-specific lessons the weapon-mod siblings also carry — which
part of speech a `traitAdjectives`/`namerLabels`-style field needs per
language, the several techniques for solving name-grammar gender (German's
inline markers, Spanish's parallel symbol families, French's rule-level
constraints, Portuguese's literal hedge), and material-neutral
trait-adjective phrasing — do not apply here, since this mod ships no
RulePackDefs and generates no names. See `../UniqueMeleeWeapons`,
`../UniqueWeaponsUnbound`, or `../PersonaWeaponsUnbound` if that ever
changes.

## Workflows

### Initial generation (`/translate <Language>`)

1. Run the checker; confirm English itself is clean.
2. Enumerate the English Keyed keys in `TSX_UI.xml` (there is currently no
   DefInjected surface to enumerate — confirm that against the sidecar
   rather than assuming it).
3. Extract the vanilla tar for the target language into the scratchpad;
   build a term list for the grounded terms above (Core + Biotech).
4. Translate via subagent(s) carrying: the glossary, the vanilla term list,
   the EN-comment requirement, placeholder rules, and formatting rules.
5. Run the checker (`--strict` for new languages); fix everything.
6. Review the diff yourself before committing. Commit message and PR text
   must state machine-assisted origin and invite native review.

### Update pass (`/translate update`)

1. Run the checker; it lists missing keys and stale entries per language.
2. Translate only that delta, refreshing each entry's EN comment.
3. Leave correct existing entries untouched. Re-run the checker.

### Audit only (`/translate check`)

Run the checker and report; change nothing.

## Optional in-game verification

RimWorld Dev Mode offers "Save translation report" and "clean up translation
files" (Verse.LanguageReportGenerator / TranslationFilesCleaner). These need a
running game with the mod loaded — useful as a final QA pass, not a
substitute for the checker.
